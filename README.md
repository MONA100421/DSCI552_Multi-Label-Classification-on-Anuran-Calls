# 🐸 Multi-Label Classification on Anuran Calls (DSCI 552 - HW7)

Perfect-score (100/100) project for **Machine Learning (DSCI 552)** at USC.  
I applied **advanced classification & clustering methods** on bioacoustic frog-call data to predict Family / Genus / Species labels.

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- Built **multi-label classifiers**: Binary Relevance + Classifier Chains.
- Tackled **class imbalance** with **SMOTE oversampling**.
- Evaluated using **Hamming score/loss, precision, recall, ROC AUC**.
- Extended analysis with **unsupervised K-Means clustering** + Hamming distance.
- Implemented full workflow in **Python / scikit-learn** with rigorous 10-fold CV.

---

## 📊 Results
- **Classifier Chains SVMs** outperformed Binary Relevance by modeling label dependencies.
- **SMOTE** improved recall for minority classes, reducing bias.
- **Clustering** revealed biologically meaningful species groupings.
